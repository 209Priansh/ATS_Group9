# ATS_Group9
The objective of this project is to minimize the cost of recruiting a
candidate for the company. You have to scrape through the profiles
which are publicly available on various job portals, and using NLP
techniques extract the features from the resumes. Then arrange them
in a structured form to create a database of required skill sets. Later
develop a resume Automatic Tracking System (ATS) model which
maps these profiles with the Job description using a score. Finally, with
the help of the model, predict the candidate who would accept the
offer.
